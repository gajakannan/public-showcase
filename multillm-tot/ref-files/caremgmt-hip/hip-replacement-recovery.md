# Hip Replacement Recovery Guidelines

## Overview
Total hip replacement is a common orthopedic surgery, particularly in older adults with osteoarthritis or injury. Recovery is generally successful, but requires careful management of mobility, pain, and potential complications.

## Post-Operative Timeline
- **Day 0–1:** Pain control, mobilization with walker or crutches, DVT prophylaxis
- **Day 2–3:** Discharge planning, physical therapy (bed exercises, sit-to-stand), wound care education
- **Week 1–2:** Home health PT 2–3x/week, stair safety evaluation, pain monitoring
- **Week 3–4:** Begin outpatient PT if mobile, focus on strength and range of motion
- **Week 5–6+:** Increase endurance, reduce assistive device use, resume light activities

## Red Flags
- Fever over 101°F
- Increased redness or drainage at incision
- Sudden increase in pain or swelling in leg
- Shortness of breath (possible pulmonary embolism)

## Restrictions
- Avoid hip flexion > 90° for first 6 weeks
- No twisting of operated leg
- Use raised toilet seat and recliner
- Sleep with pillow between legs if instructed

## Goals
- Independent mobility with or without assistive device by Week 4
- Return to basic ADLs by Week 2–3
- Transition to outpatient rehab by Week 3–4
