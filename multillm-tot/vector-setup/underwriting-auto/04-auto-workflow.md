## Renewals

- Auto-renewals allowed for clean driving records.
- Re-underwriting required if risk score worsens by more than 10%.
- Declination or surcharge possible upon discovery of unreported changes.

## Endorsements & Midterm Changes

Common changes include:
- Adding/removing drivers
- Changing address or vehicle
- Updating lienholder information

All changes must be documented and re-rated if they materially affect risk.
