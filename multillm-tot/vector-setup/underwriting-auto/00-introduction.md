# Hello Insurance Underwriting Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the Hello Insurance Underwriting Manual for Personal Auto and Restaurant Insurance Products. This guide is intended for underwriters, risk evaluators, and internal teams responsible for managing risk exposure and making underwriting decisions across personal and commercial lines.

The manual serves three purposes:
1. Provide standardized criteria for risk selection.
2. Promote consistency in underwriting decisions.
3. Act as a reference for acceptable practices, documentation, and workflows.

Underwriters are expected to apply sound judgment while adhering to these guidelines. When in doubt, refer to senior underwriters or the Risk Governance Committee.

### Key Underwriting Principles

- **Admissibility**: Is the risk insurable under our current appetite?
- **Affordability**: Can we price the risk competitively while remaining profitable?
- **Appropriateness**: Does the coverage fit the insured's true exposure?
- **Accountability**: Are exceptions clearly justified and documented?

## Product Scope

This manual covers two lines of business:
- **Personal Auto Insurance**: Private passenger vehicles used for personal purposes.
- **Restaurant Insurance**: Commercial policies for food establishments, including fast-casual, dine-in, and takeout businesses.

Both lines follow a modular underwriting process but differ in eligibility criteria, pricing models, and inspection practices.
