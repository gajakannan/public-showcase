    "content": "# Hello Insurance Underwriting Manual\n\n## Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Hello Insurance Underwriting Manual for Personal Auto and Restaurant Insurance Products. This guide is intended for underwriters, risk evaluators, and internal teams responsible for managing risk exposure and making underwriting decisions across personal and commercial lines.\n\nThe manual serves three purposes:\n1. Provide standardized criteria for risk selection.\n2. Promote consistency in underwriting decisions.\n3. Act as a reference for acceptable practices, documentation, and workflows.\n\nUnderwriters are expected to apply sound judgment while adhering to these guidelines. When in doubt, refer to senior underwriters or the Risk Governance Committee.\n\n---\n\n### Key Underwriting Principles\n\n- **Admissibility**: Is the risk insurable under our current appetite?\n- **Affordability**: Can we price the risk competitively while remaining profitable?\n- **Appropriateness**: Does the coverage fit the insured's true exposure?\n- **Accountability**: Are exceptions clearly justified and documented?\n\n---\n\n## Product Scope\n\nThis manual covers two lines of business:\n- **Personal Auto Insurance**: Private passenger vehicles used for personal purposes.\n- **Restaurant Insurance**: Commercial policies for food establishments, including fast-casual, dine-in, and takeout businesses.\n\nBoth lines follow a modular underwriting process but differ in eligibility criteria, pricing models, and inspection practices.",
